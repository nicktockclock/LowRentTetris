# LowRentTetris

This was a project created for an Intro to Game Programming at UTS, and my first foray into making a game with Unity. The idea was just to recreate a classic game with a new twist.

 It can be run using Unity. The hit detection is kind of a mess and it doesn't look great but it was a fun little project and a good start to my game creation.
